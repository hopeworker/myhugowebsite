## Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design(By Robert C. Martin)

Has the design of the systems you’ve worked on had a huge negative effect on the morale of the team, the trust of the customers, and the patience of the managers? 

These developers buy into a familiar lie: “We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!” 

The only way to go fast, is to go well.

they often focus on one to the exclusion of the other.

that’s where the second value lies

I’m using the word “shape” here in a unconventional way, but I think the metaphor is apt. Software developers often feel as if they are forced to jam square pegs into round holes.

There is a great deal of truth to this old adage. Those things that are urgent are rarely of great importance, and those things that are important are seldom of great urgency.

The dilemma for software developers is that business managers are not equipped to evaluate the importance of architecture. That’s what software developers were hired to do. Therefore it is the responsibility of the software development team to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features.

its invention predates computer programming itself.

Nowadays we are all structured programmers, though not necessarily by choice.

Source code dependencies **versus** flow of control

SRP might be the least well understood. 


A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.

You might object to these solutions on the basis that every class would contain just one function. 

If you recoiled in horror from the class design shown earlier

a fulfillment of one of the oldest promises of the object-oriented model.

at least in hindsight
